16. "Validate my AUTOSAR configuration against version 4.2.2 standards"

17. "Export complete AUTOSAR configuration for my powertrain ECU project"

18. "Merge CAN and NvM configurations for ECU_Powertrain project"

## Optimization Queries

19. "Optimize CAN message object allocation for minimal latency in engine control application"

20. "Configure NvM with optimal wear-leveling for 10-year EEPROM lifetime with 1 million write cycles"

## Tips for Creating Effective Queries:

- Be specific about ECU type (powertrain, body, chassis, telematics, gateway)
- Include baudrate for CAN (125, 250, 500, or 1000 kbps)
- Specify number of message objects or NvM blocks
- Mention critical features (error handling, wakeup, wear-leveling, CRC, redundancy)
- For safety-critical applications, mention ASIL level
- Include write strategy for NvM (immediate, deferred, triggered)

## Common Parameter Ranges:

CAN Baudrates: 125, 250, 500, 1000 kbps
CAN Message Objects: 1-128 (typically 8-32)
NvM Blocks: 1-256 (typically 10-100)
NvM Block Size: 1-65535 bytes (typically 32-512 bytes)
